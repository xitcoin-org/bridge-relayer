# Operations

## Process separation

- Run each signer under an independent operating-system identity and preferably
  on independent infrastructure.
- Run the coordinator without access to signer private keys.
- Allow signer APIs only from authenticated coordinator networks and require
  signer-side source-chain verification.
- Keep transaction submitter keys separate from bridge signer keys.

## Required safety controls

- Pin Cronos and Xitcoin chain identities, vault address, route and asset.
- Require configurable finality depth on both chains.
- Persist observed block hash, height, transaction hash and log index.
- Re-check the canonical block hash before signing and before submission.
- Stop processing automatically on RPC disagreement, reorganization beyond the
  confirmation window, signer-set mismatch or route pause.
- Expose health and metrics without exposing payload signatures or credentials.

## Watcher checkpoints

Each watcher advances its checkpoint only after every event in the scanned
range has passed a second canonical block and transaction check. A checkpoint
at the same height with a different hash is a finality violation and stops the
process. Operators must investigate RPC disagreement or a deep reorganization;
the process must never select one provider silently.

## Network adapters

- Configure at least two independent HTTPS origins for each source chain.
- Never place API keys, usernames or passwords inside an RPC URL. Inject secret
  headers only in a private runtime wrapper outside this public repository.
- Pin Cronos chain ID `25` and the intended Xitcoin CometBFT chain ID before any
  scan begins.
- Reject catching-up Xitcoin nodes, redirects, oversized responses and malformed
  JSON instead of silently retrying a different interpretation.
- Supply the Xitcoin outbound-message decoder from the canonical chain schema.
  The transport deliberately does not guess event attribute names.
- Run the scan loop without signer or submitter credentials. A successful scan
  records only `observed`, `finalized` and checkpoint state.

## Recovery

The coordinator is restart-safe. It resumes non-terminal records from the local
store and queries the destination replay-protection state before resubmission.
Operators must never delete a pending database merely to clear an error.

## Activation sequence

Protocol vectors, watcher tests, signer isolation tests, testnet deployment,
fault injection and an independent security review must all succeed before a
route configuration is proposed. Deployment alone does not authorize route
activation.
