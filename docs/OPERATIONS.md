# Operations

## Process separation

- Run each signer under an independent operating-system identity and preferably
  on independent infrastructure.
- Run the coordinator without access to signer private keys.
- Allow signer APIs only from authenticated coordinator networks and require
  signer-side source-chain verification.
- Keep transaction submitter keys separate from bridge signer keys.

## Required safety controls

- Pin Cronos and Xitcoin chain identities, vault address, route and asset.
- Require configurable finality depth on both chains.
- Persist observed block hash, height, transaction hash and log index.
- Re-check the canonical block hash before signing and before submission.
- Stop processing automatically on RPC disagreement, reorganization beyond the
  confirmation window, signer-set mismatch or route pause.
- Expose health and metrics without exposing payload signatures or credentials.

## Recovery

The coordinator is restart-safe. It resumes non-terminal records from the local
store and queries the destination replay-protection state before resubmission.
Operators must never delete a pending database merely to clear an error.

## Activation sequence

Protocol vectors, watcher tests, signer isolation tests, testnet deployment,
fault injection and an independent security review must all succeed before a
route configuration is proposed. Deployment alone does not authorize route
activation.
